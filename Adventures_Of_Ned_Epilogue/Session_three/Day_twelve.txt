-Day twelve-

The party comes across an abandoned town and see a lone figure burying what 
seems to be a grave. The man is a tall dirty blonde man with a medium build and
blue eyes. His eyes seem sunken and it looks like he hasn't seen a good nights rest
in weeks. His face is unshaven and his hair nearly reaches his eyes, his entire body
is covered in wounds, mostly slashes though plenty of bruises and many of them look fresh.

He introduces himself as Nathan, and he sounds exhausted and dead inside. His only 
goal is to find his remaining comrades that have teleported across Alenkaria and
give them a proper burial.
