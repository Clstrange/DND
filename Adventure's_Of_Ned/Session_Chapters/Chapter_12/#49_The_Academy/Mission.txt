Mission given to party from Highmage_Thexius

Description: Town of Rockwell has gone surprsingly quiet, they have a small branch
in the town and they have lost contact with them. They are concerned because the town
is mainly populated by dwarves as it is a mining town. It seems that the nearest City is having
trouble getting in contact with the town as well. I would like you to evacuate everyone and
everything of value of the Academy branch there.

Encounter: The town of Rockwell is surrounded by a large stone wall. 
It is manned constantly by Dwarven Guards and Guards are patrolling at all times throughout
the Town and Curfew is being enforced. A giant section of the town looks like it has been
burned down. The Town was attacked by Millie and the Dwarves believe she is Garneth's ally
and will be back with reinforcements so they have the town in lockdown.

Reward: 1500G
