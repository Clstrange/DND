VILLAIN | 1 HOUR of Epic Dark Sinister Dramatic Action Music
-Race to Freeman-

Cinematic:
	"As the sun sets and the new moon rises
	the darkness sweeps across the land and
	an eerie feeling is left in its wake. You
	hear howls start to echo across the land,
	quiet and distant the howls become louder 
	and in unison. You start to see beasts
	with red eyes appear out from behind and atop
	large boulders. You turn around and see that 
	a large pack of wolves is coming at you at
	a distance from the south."

Combat:
	The village is 300 feet to the north and 
	there are seven wolves behind the party
	and eight wolves along the path 200 feet 
	behind the party

	Because of the rocky terrain and how dark
	it is, any creature without dark vision
	must succeed a DC Dex saving throw of 13
	or they fall prone half way through their 
	dash.
