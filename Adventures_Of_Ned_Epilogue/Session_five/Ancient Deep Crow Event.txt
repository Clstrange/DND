---Uqiark, scourge of Nezorium---

Location: Uqiark is nested in the wreckage of a rather small village.

Discription: A huge crow that resemebles the form of a griffin but with
pitch black feathers and mandables rather than a beak.

Sneaking: If the party tries to sneak through the surrounding area 
it is a DC 17 stealth check. And the party gets half way through the 
territory before they hear a screech and after a couple of minutes they
see the crow swoop down and pick something and it flies pretty close to them and drops
it. They see a metal humanoid smash into the ground about 60ft from them.
After a round Luke's character appears as well.

Fighting: Mark's and Luke's characters meet the party fighting the crow and
join.

combat: one Ancient Deep Crow.

Loot: 2650 Gold, 3000 Silver, 15000 Copper, wand of war-mage + 2, boots of Elvenkind
