Description: Extremely large building that is only smaller in size to the royal palace.
A ton of people are running around the Manor and many of them are in red and orange robes.

Head of Family: Aldrian Balfor

Henry Balfor: Male Human: small build: Scholar's face, carries himself with 
purpose and confidence. Wears multi-layered robes of blue and gray. Crest on back of hand.

Henry Balfor conversation: "So Jenson told you to come meet me? There can only be one reason for
that. He must see you as a potential asset for the family, if you are interested, I can not 
offer you positions as full-fledged members of the family. But something tells me you wouldn't
want to be that tied down in the first place. However as adopted members you could take 
assignments from the family's mission list and be rewarded accordingly without much 
responsibility. I won't be able to give you any missions yet because I need to clear all of this
with the family heads, but I am sure they won't deny assistance from people with your kind of
firepower.

-Explain what the family does.
-Lead conversation to Nathan.

"You know, I've been trying to nail down Nathan for years and I knew there was something fishy
with that Mayor. I have a contact with the Fumus family who has a feud with that man and I am
certain he can take care of it for you. You will likely be called in as witnesses in a week or 
to. So try not to run off before then."
