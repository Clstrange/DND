Title: Highmage Thexius, Southern FireSpitter

Description: Thexius is a smaller Tiefling, he is someone who is easy to overlook. His 
wizard robes look slighlty to big for his figure and he has a pair of glasses and seems to 
always have his nose in a book. The one thing that does stand out is his bright red and orange
robes that cover him from head to toe. The robes are lined with gold and give off the vibe 
of a scorching desert.

Personality: Is fascinated in magic theory and isn't a fan of his own magic that is the 
only kind that he is talented at, fire and sand. He is highly concerned over Garneth's 
safety and that of his party.
