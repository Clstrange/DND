The family of Talis, is not a family in the traditional sense. They try to recruit anyone who 
is blessed and add them to the family. They pay for all of their members needs and they are
given a monthly stipend. The family of Talis provides healing and support to anyone who
comes knocking at their doors. They are funded by the king himself and are one of the reasons
why the royal family is so popular with the citizens. They do not charge any fees, and have nearly
zero enemies. Even the most vile of villans knows to not harm a Talis cleric because the Talis
do not discriminate on whether you are a criminal or not.
