-Day Two-
	- Arrive at the Cherry tree: Cherry tree event
	- Leave Cherry tree: Travel Dragon path
	- Leads into a Valley at night and if the players didn't accept
		any of Aquarious's quests or doesn't spend the night there
		then it flash floods

-Flash flood-
At night the rain starts pouring and whoever is awake notices that 
within a couple of hours the water level is really starting to rise 
and the water starts moving so fast and the soil is loosening up to the
point trees are starting to collapse.

- if the party moves through the night they have to spend 4hrs to get through
the danger. Each hour a d4 is rolled 
	1 - Rapids: DC str-15 or be swept away and risk drowning until saved
	2 - Lightning: DC dex-18 or take 4d10 dmg
	3 - Trees collapse: DC dex-15 or take 2d12 dmg and be trapped str-18 to escape
	4 - three Sea Hags appear and attack
- if the party doesn't move then in the morning the path is completely in ruins 
there is nearly a foot of mud and it takes the party three days to travel the next
one day worth of distance.
