Monologue:
	Ah, come in, come in. Now what have 
	you need for a witch hmmm? Hahaha, 
	I can see it in your eyes, I know why
	you are here. You have questions no?
	so many questions. Well I have answers
	though my service does not come free. 
	500 gold and your desitinies will be 
	revealed.
	
	*Maggi takes gold coins and where gold
	was gold appears* Yes, yesss, the dice
	will tell. Five dice for five stories, all
	unique, all important. Take head in what 
	I speak, for the dice speak truth. 

Regal:
Destiny- The dice speak a sad story of betrayal and 
	failure. Now the dice speak of what it is you search for. Locked away
	cold, dark dungeon, sealed away by a sorcerer's crest.

Rinarak:
Destiny- There be two forces battling for succession
	they will meet at a crossroads. The dice
	speak of the far east. There you will
	find your destiny.

Garneth:
Destiny- Surrounded by Advisaries, no where you 
	go will be safe. Your destination isn't
	the end but mearly the beginning. You
	must head north and claim what is 
	rightfully yours.

Virtue:
Destiny- I see a life in the shadows, 
	a destiny not of your own. You 
	must find your own path before 
	you are entrapped in someone elses.

Freyja:
Destiny- HAHAHAHA!!! What do we have here? Now
	this, this changes things. The farther you
	run from your fate the closer you get. 
	Responsibilities that were once off in the horizon
	are now an arms reach away.
