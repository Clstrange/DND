---King of the faerie dragons---
The party travels up the path Aquarios has shown up a small mountain into 
a cavern that is lit by colorful glowing stones. Inside they see a large faerie dragon.

The faerie dragon is a forest dragon without the immunities and instead has a lair action that changes the terrain from a roll of a d4.

When the party bests the dragon it tells them to hop on its back and it flys straight up extremely fast until everything becomes a blur and the party returns 
to the cavern they started and they can see the hole they fell into and the water streaming in from the entrance they blew up.

The party travels for a bit and when they exit the cavern they can see they are
surrounded by dwarves. The Dwarf leading the group is a large dwarf standing a foot
above the rest in bronze armor that seems to be crackling with lightning and thunder
magic. The dwarf falls to one knee, fist in the ground he bows his head and the rest
of the dwarfs follow suit. The dwarf speaks "The Acyolites of the Dragon greet our
Master. Garneth Helmfist Aspect of Denrellin Lord of Thunder"
