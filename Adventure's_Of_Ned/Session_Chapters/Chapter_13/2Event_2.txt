Intro: a messanger finds the party and tells them to find Highmage Thexius, he says it is 
extremly urgent and to meet him in office where they met last.

Highmage Thexius: "It's terrible! I don't know where they came from! It can't be 
a coincident can it? Can it!?" *Deep Breath* "The dwarves have declared war on us. The Elves
have remobilized and are smashing through our southern borders as we speak. And the Eastern 
wasteland seems to have erupted all across the land with undead consuming our eastern lands." 
We are much stronger than we were 100 years ago, but we can't fight a three pronged war for 
very long. We can handle two of the threats but the third will eventually cripple us. 
I hate this to ask this of you, but I have heard of your deeds and I think you are the 
only ones left that can handle this task. Could you...
1. Head north and Assassinate the Bronzecore Dwarven King?
2. Head south and Slay the Bloodsworn royal family?
3. Head east and Remove the source of the undead?
I am sure the King will be willing to reward you quite handsomly for you assistance and 
the academy will spare no expense in your compensation.
