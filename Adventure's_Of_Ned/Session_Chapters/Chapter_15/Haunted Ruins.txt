"HAHAHA not bad at all, I would love to test my power against your own, however
there is not point in offering a reward if I was just going to crush you 
myself. First lets fix this weather its served its purpose, now for your reward.
Hmm... here you can have my staff, I'm sure you'll eventually be able to figure
out how to use it, though until then you should keep it wrapped up, *reaches into 
robe and pulls out bandages. Now begone, unless you want to offer yourselves as a sacrifice
before me."
