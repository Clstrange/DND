--Details of Little Port--

Town is in ruins, some buildings are burned down already, most are currently on fire
it looks as though the fire started in the center of the Town and spread 
throughout everywhere

12 Dead Guards

5 Dead Civillians

2 Dead Fumus Mages

Fumus Mages are burned so badly they are barely recongizable, their red and orange robes
are melted and charred. One mage has a crest on his forearm and the other has one on the 
back of his hand.

The Ferry is missing 
only a medium sized rowboat remains, big enough for five people

there is a trail of many footsteps leading west

In Provisions shop Millie is eating food inside the burning building watching the party
waiting for them to begin to cross the river.
