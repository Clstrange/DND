The party reach G.O.N.D.O's shack and activate the 
dispel magic scroll and almost instantly they see a tear in space appear and a dwarf tumble through.
Gondo looks to be extremely bloodied, his right arm is charred black, his left eye is swollen shut
he walks with a limp and his covered in sweat and blood and his clothes are torn
and ragged. He yells in a raspy voice as he coughs up blood "I need 30 seconds" right before he vanishes
another tear opens up and a robotic dwarf with sparks flying from its chest and steam billowing from its right arm
steps out. Roll initative, the party needs to survive Robo GONDO for 5 turns
