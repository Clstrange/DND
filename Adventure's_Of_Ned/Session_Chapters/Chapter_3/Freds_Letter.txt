		---Fred's_Letter---

Not sure how trustworthy your crew here is 
so I chose rather to give you this message in 
private. 

I've lined up a job for you in Lethanial, its going 
to require your specific set of skills so I hope 
you've been practicing. 

We have a Caravan that is some rather unsightly cargo
that they need to get past the guard at the 
Fortress/City Rocks. The trading center at Lethanial
is the only place where you can obtain a lincense to
bring in confidential goods no questions asked. 

We have provided the required forms in this letter 
there are two forms, one requiring an explanation
for confidenality and signature from the mayor. 
The other just requires the seal from the trading
center. The caravan will be in the eastern caves 
right outside of Lethanial a week from now.
They will wait for you to deliver for seven days. If
you don't they will assume you declined the job
and will figure things out on their own.

After what it cost you to enter the academy I imagine
you are running low on funds so I hope you 
choose to accept this job.

Reward: 750G
Time_Limit: Two Weeks
