--Into the darkness--
Poppy: "Great job guys! Now everyone get some rest, we going to break through that wall 
as soon as noon hits"

Cinematic: Poppy gathered every able soldier, and while they all look fearful they also
look determined. Poppy has gathered enough horses for the troops and they get into formation.
It is an arrow formation with the party in the center and Poppy in the front. At the strike of
noon the group charges straight into the ever growing gray mist. The group enters the mist
and all seems calm, until all of a sudden undead are everywhere and the group smashes right into
them. Poppy is firing arrows left and right blowing up groups of undead
The group doesn't slow down for a second has their group slowly falls apart. The group
starts to fall back as the party pushes through the last bit of undead. It's now just the party
and Poppy who give the party a wink and a smile. 
When her horse gets struck with an arrow, Poppy gracefully leaps off of it spinning through the
air to fire more arrows into undead. As the party continues forward, the last thing they
see is poppy flying around like a spinning machine of death. When a flesh golem appears behind
her and a club sends her flying creating an audible crack as the party rides out of view.
