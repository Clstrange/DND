History of Gifted:
	The only Ancient Records that surpass 400 years ago is
	the battle between Alenkar and his brother the Mad King.
	Back when Man just arrived in Alenkaria two brothers rallied all of the 
	Humans under one flag. Both were unspeakably powerful born
	to magic that is lost to this day. One day a great monster threatened 
	Humanities existence. Darkness covered the sky as a Herald of Na'zirath the 
	size of a fortress attacked. The two brothers fought together slowly but 
	surely bringing the beast down. Then disaster struck as the eldest brother
	was struck down. By himself the younger brother released a forbidden spell
	in order to protect his country. The younger brother banished the 
	Shade, using his own body as a vessel to contain the monster. He then 
	melded the monster with his skin, fusing its power with his own to 
	ensure that it would never escape. The older brother was missing and presumed dead,
	and the younger brother was corrupted. Years past and the 
	younger brother's sanity wained and he was consumed by 
	hatred. Eventually the younger brother completely lost himself as he
	declared war on the entire world, annihilating any non-human beings.
	The older brother returned to see his younger brother destroying everything
	he had sought to protect. He attacked his brother taking him by surprise,
	the older brother dealt a fatal blow before the younger brother even
	understood what was happening. Upon the younger brothers death the 
	corruption inside his body released across land threatening to turn it
	into a necrotic wasteland. The older brother poured all of his life into
	his most powerful holy spell. He then speared that power through ground
	willing it to spread across the entire land cleansing it of all 
	corruption. The gifted are a side effect of this event, the power that
	Alenkar poured into the land will rarely appear inside an individual.
	Granting said individual with holy magic that is usually related to healing.

Human Magicks: 
	Dating back as far as 400 years the Human's Royal Cabal as served as 
	both powerful political actors and military assest. The Cabal consits
	of 32 of the most powerful mages in Alenkaria, some rivaling
	the Elven Purebloods. Most of the Cabal usually come from prominant 
	Sorcerer families that form the magic association,
	such as the Balfors. With the creation of the Academy
	more and more of the Cabal's ranks are being filled with prior students.

Foreign Powers: 
	While the Humans have their own Royal Cabal the Dwarvan Clans and the 
	Elven country has their own form of magic orginization. With the Dwarves
	it is the Enforcers. Each Clan has their own group of Enforcers that
	work as a police force that reports directly to the Clan's king. Little 
	is known of them as the Clan's like to keep them as secret as possible. 
	But they are equipped with anti-magic equipment that is attuned to their
	specific person. And they are the clans go-to when hunting down any
	wanted individual. The Elves on the otherhand have their PureBloods. 
	The more tightly one is born into the royal bloodline the stronger
	their magic will be; therefore the "purer" their blood is. Elven
	PureBloods are known to be the most magically potent sorcerers in
	Alenkaria though little is known how many remain after King Gavid wiped them
	out during the Siege of Armadon through the Great War.

Truth behind Elder Gods and beings of great power:
	Elder Gods hardly refers to actual Gods in any sense. They beings of
	great power that in some Elven culture are worshipped for their immense
	strength. Some examples of these "Elder Gods" would be the Dragons
	Denrellin and Fervagis. There are also beings like Na'Zirath who in some cultures
	is viewed as King of the Underworld. All that's known is that there is enough
	evidence to support that these Elder Gods are really beings, and that they 
	seem to have enough power that even after their mortal bodies were destroyed their
	spirits still exist searching for a host that can be used to resurrect them.

Colonization of Alenkaria:
	It is known that there is only one race that is truly native to Alenkaria and
	that is the Elves. It is well believed that all of the other races arrived here
	from across the ocean. Which leads us to believe that there are other lands with
	races like our own. The order that the races have arrived in Alenkaria is,
	1. Elves
	2. Humans
	3. Misc. Races
	4. Dwarves
