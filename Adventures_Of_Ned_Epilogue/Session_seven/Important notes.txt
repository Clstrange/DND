-Session Recap-
	- Previously on the AON Epilogue, The party met an undead man named Hal who gave the party information on how to get to
	get through the Holy City. The party then got divided on how to kill him and whether or not to loot his body. They then entered
	a forest dungeon where you fought a band of specteral warriors, an old Hag, and a bloodhunter and his companion Jumbo. You guys have just entered
	what appears to be a clearing where a bunch of undead are chilling around.
