-Session Recap-
	- Previously on the AON Epilogue, Crispus and Nathan leave the party heading to Solacov's Labrynth on their own leaving Dwindle to 
	find Azerlein and finish the quest on their own. Dwindle eventually finds Azerlein and they are sneaking through the Ancient Deep Crow's
	territory as Vorn and Dono Docar make their enterance through fighting with the crow (Brooke has a wonderful depiction drawn out). After Vorn
	and Dono finish slaying the Crow they meet Azerlein and Dwindle and after some negotiations the four decide to form a new party. They are
	traveling to Rinarak's City when a mini army of organized undead appears. The party chooses to sneak to the far north of their patrols and then
	blitz through their ranks. They make it through without to much trouble and are continuing their journey to complete Gondo's quest.
