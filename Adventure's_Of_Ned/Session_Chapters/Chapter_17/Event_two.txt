Garneth and Freya wake up in a different room that is has a necrotic feel to it. It has a black and green mist and Garneth is
Laying on an alter that is covered in glowing runes that stop him from moving and disable his magic. Freya is shackled to the wall.
Gondo is no where to be seen.

Krothur reveals himself as a shapeshifter who was the king's advisor, headmaster, dwarf from lethanial, recent messanger. He has the ability to see the
location of denrellin at all times so he always knew where Garneth was. He planned everything to force Garneth's isolation forcing him to join Krothur so that
Krothur can extract Denrellin's spirit from Garneth's body and truly resurrect his lord. 

He begins the ritual and creates a tether between Garneth, himself, and a black pool of matter. Garneth has to make constant con saves of DC-17 or take 1d12 dmg doubled
every turn. Every turn the black pool starts to form a body, starting at a fetus it slowly grows the more energy taken from Garneth. When the body is around the size
of a toddler a giant wave of spatial magic collides with the necrotic energy completely overrloading the room causing everything to start to collapse. The runes
holding Garneth in place stop working and he is freed.

After the fight Krothur is dead and the room is collapsing rifts start to appear and the body falls into one of the spatial cracks.

Gareth can collect the armor off of Krothur
