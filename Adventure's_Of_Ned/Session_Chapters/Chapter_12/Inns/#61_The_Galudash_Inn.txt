Owner: Galudash: Male Half-Orc:Twin to Galudash_The_Superior

Description: Inn is just run down enough to give it a slightly homey feeling.
Not to fancy but not to Ghetto, enough space to not feel cramped and a couple of customers 
lounging around while Galudash serves the customers himself. The size of the building allows
the fireplace to keep the room nice and toasty.

Bonus: Average nice Inn
