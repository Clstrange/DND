		---Chapter_Six---
0. Party is Currently at Lethanial, Thyeline is
set up to meet with the convoy to arrange for 
granting them the merchants guild seal. Most of
the Quests on the quest board has been completed.
The only remaining ones are the two at the town 
hall, one at Rickety's, and one at the Golden
Stallion.

1. Party goes to the Town Hall and takes the 
main quest, which is rather vague to the Mayor. 
He tells them to meet him at his mansion later that
night. He explains the quest to them and advises
them to meet the story teller Gjile before they 
head out.

2. Party meets Gjile who is an old man and offers
the party to listen to many of his stories. When 
they ask specifically about the situation with the
quest his expression darkens and he beckens all of 
his listeners(kid included) to come closer as he
tells the tale. Gjile shows lots of interest in
Rinarak.

3. Party head out to the north east, farther into
the mountains where the troll was killed. There 
they deep in the woods, an army of tracks leading
inside the mountain

4. Party enter Mountains and begin the combat 
session, in the last room they find another one 
of the black crystal balls, that Rinarak tries
to destroy again.
-In boss fight mini-Luca shows up really angry
and jumps onto Garneth screaming and trying to kill
him.

5. Once they finish they head back and get their 
reward from the mayor. Upon returning to Gjile, 
Gjile asks Rinarack to join him on a small journey.
It is there Gjile explains who he is and asks 
Rinarack to take his mantle as a Drudic Shepard and 
rediscover the history of Elankaria.

6. Jonathan gets a note from Nathan saying that
Theyline shouldn't have to inspect the goods to
give out the merchants seal. That is the Mayors job
and he presses him to fight Theyline about it, 
agreeing to share in profits.

7. Party heads out of Lethanial and continues 
onto Fortress Armadon
