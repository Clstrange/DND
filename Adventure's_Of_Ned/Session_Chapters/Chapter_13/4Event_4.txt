--Deserthall--
Description: Medium sized town that looks fortified with makeshift walls, ditches towers
and other defensive structures that look like they were made in a rush. Beyond Desert hall
the party can see an ever growing cloud of darkness that seems to be getting ever so closer to
the Town, town looks like it is in the middle of evacuating.

Mayor: Tofiz, male tiefling who is looks extremely paranoid and seems to be everywhere at once. 
"Hello. I don't know why you've come this way but run, run as far west as you possibly can
its been less than a week and we've barely held out this long. And that is only because we were
lucky enough to have Poppy who was staying here while on her journey.

Poppy: Female Human ranger, who looks extremely tired. Is covered in injuries but none that
look to threatening. 
"Thanks goodness! The capital sent assistance, quick I need you posted *points to various 
locations* the undead are mostly active at night, but any we kill in the day is less we
get swarmed by once the sun falls."

"You are here to end what caused this? Well if you plan on entering that darkness be warned
I've gotten the closest out of everyone and there's practically a wall of undead crawling 
at that border. But if the academy really thought you could fix this then I'll have to 
trust you, and I think my guys and myself can punch a hole in their forces wide enough for you 
guys to slip through. However that needs to be done at the peak of noon, when the undead are
weakest. And that means we have to last through the night, what do you say? You help us and we 
help you."
