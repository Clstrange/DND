Description: You see a cloaked hunched figure slowly walking to you
inside the hood you see two glowing green misty eyes. He looks like
a human but his skin is withered and his limbs are twisted around 
and bent in horrible angles.

Dwindle: "Dwindle Sumner, I am but a humble servant of the great
Na'zirath Oocerious and I have come to help.
I can sense your condition, doesn't it hurt? Your family abandoning you,
your body stolen from you, forced onto an excruciating journey that 
you were forced into because you had no other choice. Na'zirath can
take all of your pain away, she can free you of your burdens and 
give you the power to become the Elf that you wish to be."
"I will respect your wishes, however I will leave you this potion
It can not heal your ailment but it will mend broken bones and seal
up flesh wounds. If you decide to change your mind I'll be at 
Rinarack's Fortress waiting.

Azerlein: "Azerlein of the Bloodsworn Elves, I am a simple man
Oocerious and I have come to offer my assistance in the name of Na'zirath.
I know much about you Azerlein, I know that no matter how hard you try
it will never be enough for your family. Your clan will always see you
as a failure no matter how much you succeed. I know you have always
been inferior to your cousin Freya, but I also know that can change.
Na'zirath can grant you the power to change your destiny, to not only
surpass Freya but your entire clan as well. Don't give me your answer
yet, I'll be in Rinarack's fortress waiting and in the mean time I'll leave
this with you, it was Freya's own weapon "Frost Brand." She made the 
decision to die rather than take ahold of the opportunity before her, I
would advise you not to make the same mistake.
