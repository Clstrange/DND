		---Search and Destroy---

Description: 'See mayor for details'

(Mayor): Thank you for coming, I ask that
you don't speak of this quest to anyone outside
of this room. I would like to avoid needless panic.
I'm sure you have noticed that monster activity has
been increasing in all of the surrounding areas. 
The town of Freeman would have been wiped out if 
not for your group. However it has been eerie silent
around here these last few months. Besides the 
occasional wolves and the rare troll it is like all
of the monsters have vanished. And because of it
our city guard has become extremely lax. This 
concerns me greatly because two weeks ago
I hired two men to search deep into the 
mountains and they have yet to return. They were
two highly skilled rangers and I am afraid of what
could have happened to them. I believe the monsters
in the area have been amassing in the mountains
and the military won't act on my "gut feelings."
If I am right I will pay a handsome reward for you
to take care of them for me.

(Mayor): By the way were you ever able to figure
out what was causing the wolves to go rampant
at Freeman?

(Mayor): Interesting, try to be descreet about it
but you might want to visit old man Gjile at the
Richety Inn. He's a story teller who knows a lot 
more than most, he might know a thing or to
about what that glass ball was.
