	in charge so I directed her to the mayor. I heard some shouts coming from the mayors

	house was on fire and the guards rushed towards the building. That's when the
	real fighting began. Twelve guards and two fire mages vs her, and then everything was
	on fire and some villagers died next thing everyone was running 
	trying to get out as soon as possible.
