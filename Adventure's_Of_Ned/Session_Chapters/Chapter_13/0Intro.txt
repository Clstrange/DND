Recap: Got to capital, fought Hestia who retreated after snatching blood from Rinarack 
and Freya. Learned a bit of suspicous stuff is going on in the Eastern Wastelands.


Intro: Party has decided to take it easy after having finally arrived at the Capital. For
once life seems to be calming down, the Academy along with the support of King Gavid are
keeping the Dwarves back from doing anything to rash. With the increased security the 
capital brings, monster sightings have been going down and roads have been getting safer.
The party has decided to take it slow, taking jobs here and there attending classes at the
academy and just enjoying life for a bit. This goes on for 42 days, so that it is the day
before winter and preparations for the winter festival are going underway.
