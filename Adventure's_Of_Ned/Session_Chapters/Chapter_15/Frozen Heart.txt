Summary: As the party approaches the Lake the party can hear a distant 
tune coming from the frozen lake. They can see multiple light blue humanoid spirits
that look like the are made out of thin ice
in snow white dresses spinning around slowly dancing aimlessly to that far off tune,
you can also here a light clinking sound that seems to be playing in rhythm as well.

If the party chooses to investigate, then as they get closer they can feel the air get colder
and they can see figures in the distant sychronisly mining away at mounds of ice
and in the center of it all there appears to be an item encased in the ice.
