---The Great Ambush---
The party has boarded Halieve's ship and fleet heads out around dawn, by the time
it gets dark the fleet is entering dwarven waters and everyone is on guard.
It is a moonless cloudy night and no lights are allowed so not to give the massive
fleet away. As the fleet begins to approach where the shore is expected to be the 
party makes a perception check of DC-14 to notice some barrels floating in the 
water below. One of the ships in the distance blows up in flames and chaos ensues.
The barrels in the water are explosives that denonate on impact with a ship. 
Bells start ringing from the shore and lights go up everywhere and the party can
see it was a trap. Giant battlements from the shore start launching at the fleet
and much smaller ships full with dwarves start appearing out of hidden locations 
and the fighting begins. The captain gets the party to the drop off point as they 
fight against dwarves that are boarding their ship and as the party is swimming away
they see a barrel launch through the air and blow apart the ship.

The party must make a perception check to find the weakened rock to try and blow
and entrance to. DC-20 coming back up for air risks beng spotted and every fail
under water doubles the damage taken starting at 1d10. Then strength saving
throws need to be made to hammer in all four spikes DC-18.

---Enter the feywild---
The party blows open the entrance and gets sucked in and down a waterfall that seems
carry them down 30 minutes. When the water finally calms the party realizes they are
in a completely different location.
